# NeoVim setup

## Introduction

Install NeoVim and ensure it's added to PATH.

## Pre-requisites

Because we're doing this without Mason and other automated software management, we need to set up all auxilliary things ourselves.

### Languages

We assume we're working with 4 main languages:

1. Julia
2. R
3. C
4. Python

All of these need to be installed first.
